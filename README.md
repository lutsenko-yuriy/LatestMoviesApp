# Latest Movies App


An app to test my skills and take a deeper look at the latest tech stack for Android. Based on [The MovieDB API v3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

The tech stack is:
* [Kotlin Programing language](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview)
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)

In order to run the app pulled from the repository [a new API key should be provided](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and stored in the app as a string resource `R.string.api_key`.


If you have received the app as a zip archive from the author himself you are ready to build and run the app right away.
